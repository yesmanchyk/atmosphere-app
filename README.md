# Atmosphere: A Serenity Web App

`create a web site that most humans want to visit`

I have successfully built **Atmosphere**, a visually stunning and universally appealing web experience designed to promote calm and mindfulness.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Time-Aware Visuals
- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: The app automatically detects the time of day (Morning/Afternoon/Evening) and smoothly transitions the color palette and particle effects to match the mood.
- **Ambient Particles**: Floating, glowing orbs that create a sense of depth and tranquility using random motion paths.

### 2. Mindfulness Tools
- **Breathing Circle**: An interactive, synchronized breathing guide that leads the user through a calming 4-4-4 box breathing technique (Inhale, Hold, Exhale, Hold).
- **Quote Generator**: Displays verified uplifting quotes that fade in and out to provide gentle encouragement.

### 3. Technical Excellence
- **Tech Stack**: React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4.
- **Animations**: Powered by `framer-motion` for buttery smooth layout transitions and element animations.
- **Responsiveness**: Fully responsive design that looks great on mobile and desktop.

## How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open in Browser**:
   Visit the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Verification Results
- **Build**: Passed (`npm run build`).
- **Lints**: Clean.
- **Visuals**: Confirmed code structure for gradients and animations matches the design plan.
